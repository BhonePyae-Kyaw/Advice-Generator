## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

I learned a little more about HTML, CSS and building responsive design using media queries.
But I believed there are a lot of areas I still need to improve.

I used CSS grid property in this project, which I just learned recently.

I learned more about git(commit, add, push, fetch, pull) and deployment using git pages.

### Area I need to focus more in the future
- Semantic HTML
- CSS property
- Responsive design
- React js
